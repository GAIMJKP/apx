# Introduction
My name is Van-Phu HA, currently is Ph.D. student at CAIRN team, INRIA, Bretagne Atlantique, France. This is a hub for summarizing the survey of Approximate Computing techniques for several levels (Algorithmic, Functional, Operator and Number Representation Approximation) and several layers in a Embedded System. It is also the place for dicussing and giving the directions of Approximate Computing in the context of many new technologies appeared. The main contributions of this hub is to summarize, classify and update state-of-the-art Approximate Computing methods in the world. Moreover, it is also a guideline for newcomers in this field.

Energy Consumption is one of the major issues for computing today, covered by all domain in computer science, from High Performance Computing to Embedded system. Particularly, in the forecoming era of Dark Silicon, the benefits from transistor scaling is diminished by the power limitation wall, the requirements for improving the computational performance to address many problem in BigData, Internet of Thing (IoT), Artifficial Intelligence (AI), High Performance Computing (HPC) are a must. Approximate Computing was defined quite a long time but is receiving the increased attention recently because it is one of the best solutions for energy efficiency. The major aim of Approximate Computing is to consider the trade-off of Accuracy-Cost to gain the efficiency. 

The appearance of Approximate Computing starts the another thought of algorithm deployment without the "absolutely accuracy" because of inherent "imperfectly precision" of Application ...

The classification of Approximate Computing methods ...

First of all, Approximate Computing is received a lot of attention from both academics and industries recently, even though the definition and its appearance was in quite a long time ago.
# Application Level

# Software Level

# Architecture Level

# Circuit Level

# Transistor Level

# Word Length Optimization (WLO)
Multiple Word Length Optimization is considered as NP-hard 

# Good Conferences for Approximate Computing 
I list some of good Conferences and Journals for looking for up-to-date news, methodologies for Approximate Computing as bellows
