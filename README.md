# Introduction
My name is Van-Phu HA, currently is Ph.D. student at CAIRN team, INRIA, Bretagne Atlantique, France. This is a hub for summarizing the survey of Approximate Computing techniques for several levels (Algorithmic, Functional, Operator and Number Representation Approximation) and several layers in a Embedded System. The classification of Approximate Computing methods ...

First of all, Approximate Computing is received a lot of attention from both academics and industries recently, even though the definition and its appearance was in quite a long time ago.
